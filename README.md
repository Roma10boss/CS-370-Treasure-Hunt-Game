# CS-370-Treasure-Hunt-Game

## Brief Explanation of the Project Work

In this project, I worked on implementing a treasure hunt game using reinforcement learning techniques. The game involved navigating a maze to find hidden treasures while avoiding obstacles.

The provided code included functions for initializing the maze environment, defining the agent's actions and rewards, and training the reinforcement learning model. My task was to modify and integrate my code with the existing framework to improve the maze-solving capabilities of the agent and enhance the gaming experience for the user.

## Learning Connection to Computer Science

### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists work on developing algorithms, designing software systems, and solving complex computational problems. In the context of this project, computer scientists utilize their skills to create interactive and engaging games, leveraging techniques like reinforcement learning to enhance gameplay and provide challenging experiences for users.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I approach problems systematically by breaking them down into smaller, manageable tasks, identifying patterns, and applying computational thinking principles. For this project, I analyzed the game requirements, identified key components such as the maze environment and agent behavior, and developed algorithms to solve the maze efficiently and optimize the gameplay experience.

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist, I have ethical responsibilities to ensure the integrity, security, and privacy of the systems and software I develop. In the context of game development, this includes providing a safe and enjoyable experience for users, respecting their privacy and data rights, and avoiding harmful or offensive content. Additionally, I must consider the societal impact of the games I create and strive to promote diversity, inclusivity, and fairness in their design and implementation.
